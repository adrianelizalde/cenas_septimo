# El Séptimo

Website for tracking El Séptimo's weekly dinners, and help @adrianelizalde learn to code (alhough he is  already a pro) 

Goals of the project:

- Help @adrianelizalde learn to code
- Keep track of who cooked and how many times
- Keep track of who cleaned and how many times
- Run lottery for deciding who cleans

## Ideas: buy Adrian a nice cofee every morning.

- Add some sort of storage so we can store data
- Add an animated roulette with the faces of everyone for the lottery([this is pretty cool](http://demo.st-marron.info/roulette/sample/demo.html))
- Add lottery probabilities based on number of times cleant (more times = smaller probability)
- We could track who cooked when, and take a picture of each lunch
- We could allow people to vote for each lunch, and make some sort of ranking
